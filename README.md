# Reconstruction of Ancestral HAplotype Map of Inbred Strains (AHAMIS)

## Overview

In the process of establishing inbred strains in laboratories, the chromosomes of ancestral animals recombined to form the genomes of the inbred strains.  We reconstructed the patchwork of ancestral haplotypes in current inbred strains by using the whole genome sequences.  Since the ancestral laboratory animals were taken from genetically diverse wild rats, any chromosomal segment differed at many variants between two ancestral chromosomes.  An ancestral haplotype of a chromosomal segment (AHS) that was transmitted to multiple inbred strains appears as a haplotype segment shared among the strains.  Consequently, the haplotypes of a chromosomal segment across current inbred strains comprise of one or several classes of distinct haplotypes.  One class of haplotypes are distinct from other haplotypes at many variants on the chromosomal segment, and the variants are in complete linkage disequilibrium.  Using this property inversely, we reconstructed AHSs by observing variants in linkage disequilibrium.  By enumerating all AHSs and computing their overlaps, we reconstructed the map of AHSs in the inbred strains.
